# portfolio-mobile-first

## Goals 
To create a mobile friendly version of my portfolio using mobile first design
Link this project to my current portfolio and only users on mobile should see a prompt to visit this one instead
Test landscape and portrait to ensure it's looking as intended
Use an online mobile testing service to see how a myriad of devices will render this app. 

## Reflections
I've built this website over a couple of days and kept it relatively simple but effective. I think this gives it a clean look and I'm on the fence whether it should replace my main portfolio or not. React Bootstrap helped with a lot of mobile containers but I still found I had to use custom CSS to get it working on most devices. I didn't mind doing this, because it was great practice to use media queries and test multiple devices. 

I enjoyed building this app. I kept my code a lot tidier and split out my components. This saved a lot of time when I had to go back and fix something, it was very easy to find (compared to my other portfolio code set). 

## Where to from here?

My next application is going to be a mobile friendly website for my local bakery. I haven't approached them yet, but I'm hoping to make some mocks and see if they're keen to have a website. If successful, that will be my third website I've created to help others out. I really enjoy the satisfaction and joy people display when they see the effort you've gone to, in order to create a pretty sweet website!
